# Python Multigit

A Python version of the [multigit Bash script](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/simplest-git-subrepos).

While the multigit Bash script at [simplest-git-subrepos](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/simplest-git-subrepos) was created for illustration purposes, this one is intended to be a full-fledged implementation.

The general idea is to offer a simple way of managing *"workspaces"* integrating multiple git repos starting from a top one, and without the need of difficult *"arcanes"* like *git submodules*, *git-subtree*, etc.: you only need to declare your intended *layout* in a YAML file, and let this script do its job.  See the [simplest-git-subrepos README](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/simplest-git-subrepos) for a long-wired explanation.
