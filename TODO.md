# TO-DO
Pending actions, general notes, etc. (in no particular order):
* Refactor code related to presentation/logging.
* Find the way to self-document the python dictionary that represents subrepos for easier reuse.
* Find the way for Sphinx to offer a drop-down to select git tag-tied versions of documentation.

## IN PROGRESS
