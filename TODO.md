# TO-DO
Pending actions, general notes, etc. (in no particular order):
* Review https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll
* Refactor code related to presentation/logging.
* Find the way to self-document the python dictionary that represents subrepos for easier reuse.
