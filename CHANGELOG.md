# CHANGELOG

## Next Release

* BME files added to .gitattributes (as BASH type).
* setup.py deleted as it's needed no more along setuptools.
* setup.cfg declared UTF-8.
* Development dependencies relaxed.

## 0.11.4-2
### Added
* A github action now [publishes Sphinx-based code documentation to GitHub Pages](https://jmnavarrol.github.io/python-multigit/).
* Build environment refactoring to support this new feature.

## 0.11.4-1
### Added
* [#8](https://github.com/jmnavarrol/python-multigit/issues/8): [setup.cfg](./src/setup.cfg) updated so it can manage different dependencies depending on running Python version.
