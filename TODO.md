# TO-DO
Pending actions, general notes, etc. (in no particular order):
* Refactor code related to presentation/logging.
* Find the way to self-document the python dictionary that represents subrepos for easier reuse.
* Find the way for Sphinx to offer a drop-down to select git tag-tied versions of documentation.
  * https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/my-sphinx-best-practice-for-a-multiversion-documentation-in-different-languages
* Refactor code so Makefile, pyproject.toml are at the repository's root?

## IN PROGRESS
